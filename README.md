## Intro

Spec-NeRF jointly optimizes the degradation parameters and achieves high-quality multi-spectral image reconstruction results at novel views, which only requires a low-cost camera (like phone camera but in RAW mode) and several off-the-shelf color filters. We also provide real scenario and synthetic datasets for related studies.

## Preliminaries

We conduct our experiments based on [TensoRF](https://apchenstu.github.io/TensoRF/), you are welcome to test our code using `spec` branch in this repo, but it may lack of some comments since the code is still being organized. Feel free to report issues, we'd be very appreciate it!



#### Tested on Ubuntu 18 / Windows 11 + Pytorch 1.11 + cuda 11.3
